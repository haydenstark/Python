# Python

These are a handful of assignments competed during my Python course with The Tech Academy.  
(For unmentioned projects - description is the title of the folder)

## Phonebook_App
A phonebook application, where the user can add a new entry, including a person's first name, last name, phone number, and email, and save it locally to a database. This assignment helped understand importing built in functionality, as well as creating and importing custom modules.

## Py_db
Simple assignment practicing connecting to a database and saving documents to it.

## Student_Tracker
An application that is an extension off of Phonebook_App. Keeps track of a student's first name, last name, phone number, email, and current course. This app has add, create, read and update functionality. When a student is highlighted, the appropriate fields are populate with the student's information.

## Nice_or_Mean
A simple game with branching logic that keeps track of the player's actions - whether or not they are "nice" or "mean" to strangers they encounter. Player wins or loses depending on how nice or mean they were.
